# Persistance
Finding high Persistance Numbers

**Requires numpy!**


Currently have to main classes that run two functions
Persistance just finds the persistance of a number and returns the persitance
  It also contains a simple function to take the product of the string of numbers.

NumberSearch currently only finds the prime factors of a given number, and actualy dose not contribute to the finding of new high persistance numbers.
  Contains factors() that finds prime factors, and primesfro2to() to find primes.
  
__main__ just interfaces with the other classes
